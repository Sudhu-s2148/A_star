# A_star
This project implements the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm in C++, a powerful heuristic search algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes on a grid or graph.To make the algorithm more interactive and easier to understand, the project uses the Raylib graphics library for real-time visualization
